# Webflyx-App

ðŸŽ¬ A minimal, experimental web app for exploring film data and classic titles.

## Overview
Webflyx-App is a lightweight movie content explorer. It parses structured CSV/Markdown files
and displays curated film lists, quotes, and metadata through a simple web interface.

## Features
- Reads `.csv` and `.md` content dynamically
- Supports classic film metadata
- Ready for future integration with AI-powered recommendation modules

## File Structure
- `quotes/` â€” text-based quote collections
- `classics.csv` â€” main dataset
- `contents.md` / `titles.md` â€” supplemental text data

## Future Plans
- Add React/Vite frontend for user interaction
- Integrate TMDB or IMDb APIs
- Enable AI-based categorization
